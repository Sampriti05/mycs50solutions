If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

audio aura can be linked to category of the song hence for example a red aura can represent songs of a angry nature such as rock and phonk music
so from a listeners top hundred we find out the category of music they have most listened to for example they have listened to many rock songs
we can give them a red aura. Same applies to other categories, to assign categories to colors we can do some research in the art and literature fields
example yeallow can be joyous music which gives summer vibes.

if the top categories are tied say summer edm songs and rock songs we can give them a mixture of a red and yellow aura


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

It may not be representative as the listener might not only use spotify as their source of music they could also listen to music n Youtube. The songs they listen on youtube
may also be of completely different category such as rap. A better way of calculating their aura would be to link databases such as Spotify Apple Music and Youtube to give
a more accurate description.
