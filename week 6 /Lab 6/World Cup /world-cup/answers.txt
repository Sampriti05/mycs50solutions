Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

My prediction was that as N increases the time taken by the program would increase and it is proven correct by the above timings.
the timings are increasing exponentially

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I believe 100000 simulations would be a good boundary as from the results above we can see that the difference between the timing as we add more zeros is increasing
while the difference between 10000 and 100000 is 0m0.600 estimate the difference between 100000 and 1000000 and 0m7.000 estimate which will give a much larger cost
hence 100000 is the sweet spot which proveds a balance between accuracy and cost effectiveness.
