<h2> Tech Used </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Unity</li>
  <li>C# language</li>
</ol>

<h2>What is Unity?</h2>

Unity’s industry-leading platform provides tools to create and operate amazing games and other real-time interactive experiences and publish them to a wide range of devices.Unity uses implementations of the .NET runtime, making C# the most popular game development language. The engine compiles your C# code for each target device, so you can deploy to desktop, mobile, consoles, AR, and VR platforms.

<h2>What is PongMaster! about?</h2>

The main language used is C#.This game was developed through Unity. Scripts have been created for each sprite - player paddle, computer paddle, ball.Scripts were also created for Gamemanager, Bounciness of surface(for the top and bottom wall) and the Scorezones(for the left and right wall)

<h2>How to play?</h2>

Left side panel of the game is the players paddle. Right side panel of the game is the Computer’s paddle.
Your up and down arrow key in your keyboard will make the paddle move accordingly, this is a function set up using the code under the paddle. Player must hit the ball accurately in the center of the paddle for the point to count. After every point the ball will respawn at the center and the default positions of the paddle will also be at the center.

<h2> How does the point system work?: </h2>

If the ball hits the right wall a point goes to the player while if it hits the left wall a point goes to the computer
the score on the left panel indicates the player points while the score on the right panel indicates the score of the computer.

<h2> Other key mentions: </h2>

<ul>
  <li>A simple algorithm where the computer paddle follows the balls position is put into place through code -> it is made in such a way that the computer misses some balls too.</li>
  <li>The 4 boundaries of the ball hitting the wall is placed through Unity</li>
  <li>Paddles have gravity and drag set to them</li>
  <li>The bounceback of the ball is set into place by a function called physics in Unity</li>
  <li>If the ball hits the top and bottom wall it will proceed at a sharper angle as I have made the top and bottom walls to be bouncy via unity</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>What I have learnt through this project</h3>
 
 Through the learning of C I was able to apply the general functions and usage and was able to create scripts in C#.I learnt that the general functioning of code is the same across different languages and that the syntax was the only differentiating factor.I allso used tutorials available on Youtube to learn how to use Unity to create games.Hence the creation of this PongMaster! game was very educational.

 <h3>About CS50</h3>
 CS50 is a openware course from Havard University and taught by David J. Malan

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students’ choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development).
